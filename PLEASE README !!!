Also check out these:
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime  -- how to deploy to Heroku - we will use the container registry method.

As so:

Install the Heroku CLI
Download and install the Heroku CLI.

If you haven't already, log in to your Heroku account and follow the prompts to create a new SSH public key.
$ heroku login


Log in to Container Registry
You must have Docker set up locally to continue. You should see output when you run this command.
$ docker ps


Now you can sign into Container Registry.
$ heroku container:login

Push your Docker-based app
Build the Dockerfile in the current directory and push the Docker image.
$ heroku container:push web


Deploy the changes
Release the newly pushed images to deploy your app.
$ heroku container:release web


If you are using a third party CI/CD platform, you can push images to the registry. First authenticate with the following information:

Registry URL: registry.heroku.com
Username: your Heroku email address
Email: your Heroku email address
Password: your Heroku API key
